# BillBadger: my first application

This is the first application I have built. It will be a more usable version of BillMonk and more creative than Venmo.

The application is practice to learn Ruby on Rails, and somewhat follows [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/)
